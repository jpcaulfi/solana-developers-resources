# Hackathon Examples

Some basic Solana building blocks represented in test suites.   
   
Pull them down and run the tests in each `package.json` to see what they do & how they work!   
   
**You'll need to deploy the program first:**
```shell
npm run deploy
npm run test
```

These programs are written for `localnet` testing, but can be modified to use `devnet`.
